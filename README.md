# log

Yet another Go Logger

log is simple extended version of standard 'log' package based on logLevel
most of the concepts inspired from [glog](https://godoc.org/github.com/golang/glog) and [tracelog](https://github.com/goinggo/tracelog) these packages are huge and complex.

Hence we writing our own log package with as simple as possible and extensible to third party logging systems such as Papertrail, Loggly, LogDNA.
